Bateman
-------

Bateman is an in-progress trading system meant to screen a subset of the US equities markets and tests out how well a simple long-only trading strategy will work.

It's based off the observation that many symbols display sufficient daily volatility that their high will generally be significantly above their open, regardless of their price at the close of trading.

The strategy is meant to have its parameters refined by particle swarm optimization.

It's currently not ready yet.
